# A Comparison of Real-Time Operating Systems and Their Schedulers

This repository contains the research paper **"A Comparison of Real-Time Operating Systems and Their Schedulers"**, which provides an in-depth analysis of various real-time operating systems (RTOS) and the scheduling algorithms they use to manage tasks and processes.

The paper was written for Syracuse University's CIS-657 Principles of Operating Systems with Professor Mohammed Abdallah during the April 2024 term.

## Key Topics

- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Overview of RTOS and embedded system concepts and key features.
- **Schedulers**: Comparison of different scheduling algorithms and their efficiency in real-time environments.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of how each RTOS and scheduler handles task scheduling under strict timing constraints.
